# Snapfile

An anonymous file transfer application that enables you to access files from any device without any account


## Features
* anonymous chat room
* file transfer across any devices where a modern browswer is available
* secure:
    * all user data (messages and files) will be encrypted. Since passcode is never persisted in the server side, no one except the owner can decrypt the data
    * expires automatically after one day


## Install & Run

### Getting started quickly
prerequisites

* Python 3.8
* Redis
* Node.js 18+ (for the new Vue-based client)

```sh
# 1. download source code
cd
git clone https://github.com/yanxurui/Snapfile
cd Snapfile

# 1.1 install client dependencies & build assets
cd client
npm install
npm run build
cd ..

# 2. change default configuration
vim snapfile/config.file

# 3. install package
python setup.py -e .

# 4. start
snapfile
```

some default configuration
* PORT: The server will listen to port 8090
* LOG_FILE: Logs are output to `test.log` in the current workding directory (i.e., CWD)
* UPLOAD_ROOT_DIRECTORY: Files are stored in `./upload` in CWD

### Deploy in production mode (CentOS)
Change the `prefix` and `user` in `install.sh` and then run it using root
```sh
git pull
bash install.sh
```

The directory structure of `prefix`(/var/www/snapfile for example)
```
`-- snapfile
    |-- db
    |   `-- appendonly.aof
    |   `-- dump.rdb
    |-- files
    |   `-- 324
    |       `-- thfaxm
    |           `-- 1
    |-- logs
    |   |-- nginx_access.log
    |   |-- nginx_err.log
    |   |-- snapfile.log
    |   `-- snapfile.out
    `-- static
    |-- assets
    |   `-- *.js / *.css (generated by Vite)
    |-- index.html
    `-- login.html
```

> `snapfile/static` is now generated by the Vue build. Edit the source under `client/` and run `npm run build` whenever you need to update the UI assets.

### Client (Vue + Vite)

The legacy jQuery UI has been migrated to Vue 3 with Vite.

```sh
cd client

# install dependencies
npm install

# start Vite dev server with backend proxying to the Python app on :8080
npm run dev

# produce production assets into ../snapfile/static
npm run build

# locally preview the production build
npm run preview
```


## Development

### AIOHttp
This is a web app based on aiohttp (built on top of asyncio) which is an asynchronous http libaray. That means, its networking operations are non-blocking and all http requests can be processed in a concurrent manner in a single thread. So far, it's the best choice in the Python world for constructing a high performance web server.

It supports websocket (long connection) which allows to implement the instant messaging or chat very easily.

### NGINX

1. serve static files, such as html, css, etc
2. handle download efficiently
3. prevent from brute force attack
4. sharing port 443 with other services and forwarding to the backend (python web app in our case)

### Redis
keys:

* `#files:<folder identity>` int: the last file id in a given folder
* `folder:<folder identity>` str: meta data of a folder serialized in json format, like created time, quota, size, etc
* `messages::<folder identity>` list: messages (including file meta data) serialized in json format

### Supervisord
manage the lifecycle of the service
To restart the service, run the command below as root:
```
supervisorctl restart snapfile
```

### Test

need to install packages: websocket-client

#### test_api.py
Functional test for APIs of python backend:
using the classical python unittest
```sh
cd tests
python -m unittest -v test_api.py
```

* use a separate port 8090
* select db 0 of Redis
* clean all data at startup

some known issues:

The error below is due to a bug in package requests: [Revert PR 1440, do not modify cookie value by yanxurui · Pull Request #5459 · psf/requests](https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/5459)

```
json.decoder.JSONDecodeError: Expecting property name enclosed in double quotes: line 1 column 2 (char 1)
```

There might be a chance that test_api.TestExpire fails because the orphan process is cleang the data.
```
AssertionError: '1 folders found and 0 folders deleted' not found in 'xxx
```

#### test_nginx.py
Functional test for NGINX config in a production environment.

#### benchmark.py
stress test for aiohttp.
